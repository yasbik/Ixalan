# Purpose

Ixalan aims at providing movie tickets at cheap and affordable prices.
It also comes with an easy-to-use app through which you can conveniently book tickets, buy merchandise and even earn loyalty points!

Our Application can provide you with a one stop shop for all your movie viewing needs and movie related memorabila. 
With flexible payment options you can books the ticket to the movies you want to watch when you want and pay for them how ever you please!

# Running the app
---

The user can use the app as either a guest or a registered user.

To login as a registered user, enter user ID "David Doyle" with password "admin1234" (note that this is one of many user accounts)

The user can then search what movies are available (these will show up as either upcoming or currently running movies).
The app also provides a search feature so that the user can search for specific movies.

Once a movie of interest is clicked, the user can view details about the movie such as its rating, synopsis, cast etc.
The user can also book a ticket for this movie. This entails choosing a theatre location and specific seating to match one's requirements.

In addition to movie tickets, the user can also view and buy custom movie merchandise under each movie.

Finally, the app provides several methods of payment including making purchases using loyalty points.

Registered users can accumulate points by making more purchases in-app.
